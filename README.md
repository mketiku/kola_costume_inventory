# Costume Inventory DatabaseManager
Inventory Management application to assist with cataloguing costumes, props and accessories by the Costume Shop for the Theater department.

Butler University Theater is an incubator for the next generation of theatre artists. Renown as one of the best programs in the country, Butler Theatre strives to push the boundaries of art as we create innovative productions and instill graduates an entrepreneurial spirit that will help them to succeed in an ever-changing market. With a strong liberal arts foundation, they foster the development of well-rounded, critical-thinking artists who can plot their own successful path in theatre and in life.

A critical portion of the Theatre department is the costume shop. Under the umbrella of the costume shop; props, clothes, shoes, and other items are created, modified, maintained and provided to the department for use in productions. As a result of the support role that the costume shop gives to the theatre department a lot of items are collected and stored for future use. These items are numerous and at times difficult to manage as the years go on. The university granted the department space beneath the soon-to-be-constructed parking garage to store their costumes and props, and the department would like to acquire an efficient cataloging system to coincide with the transfer.

The Butler University Theater Costume Shop (BUTCS) department seeks an organizational app for costume storage. The hope is to attach barcodes to costumes and large accessories and associate that barcode with a page that allows an item history to be tracked via pictures, search phrases/categories in terms of available rentals, current location, and last time of use etc.

Our Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) team is tasked with creating an application that will facilitate cataloguing of the Theatre Departmentâ€™s stock alongside a few added bells and whistles such as rental and administrative systems. With the guidance of facilitator, Dr. Panos Linos, we aim to provide an adequate solution.
